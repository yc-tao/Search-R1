INITIAL SUMMARY (from last section of note):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Summary of Diagnoses and Conditions:**

- **Primary Diagnosis:** Colorectal cancer (colon cancer) post-laparoscopic sigmoidectomy and coloproctostomy
- **Secondary Conditions:**
  - Hypoxemia
  - Diabetes Mellitus, Type II
  - Hypertension, Benign
  - Alcohol Abuse
  - Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)
  - Volume Overload
  - Potential Pulmonary Edema
  - Hypercarbia
  - Hyperlipidemia

**Key Findings:**
- The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, alcohol abuse, and obesity.
- Post-operative hypoxia is likely due to volume overload and potential pulmonary edema.
- Hypercarbia is attributed to OSA and obesity.
- Persistent hypertension and tachycardia are managed with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors.
- The patient is on prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

**Plan:**
- Maximize control of blood pressure and heart rate.
- Monitor and manage fluid balance.
- Consider CPAP or BiPAP if hypoxia persists.
- Continue pain management and wound care.
- Maintain glycemic control and nutrition.
- Monitor for signs of alcohol withdrawal.

Passage 1 (ID: episode_436372_piece_55, Score: 9.06):
"Note Piece 55"
Will transition from
   IV to PO BBL and resume ACEI. No clear signs of nosocomial pneumonia
   except rising WBCs, will check sputum, mobilize OOB, and hold off on
   antibiotics. Discontinue ativan as he does not have symptoms of
   withdrawal at this point. CPAP at night for known OSA. POC per surgical
   team; ADAT. Above confirmed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] via email and with surgical
   HS at bedside. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

Passage 2 (ID: episode_436372_piece_54, Score: 3.33):
"Note Piece 54"
CXR with B perihilar fullness and L>R ASD. CTA (wet read)
   without clear central clot, subpulmonic loculated effusion on L,
   perihilar / dependent GG changes. Agree with plan to manage acute respiratory distress with HR/BP control
   with labetalol IV and lasix for likely volume overload and element of
   acute diastolic heart failure given preserved EF on recent echo. No
   clear signs of nosocomial pneumonia, will check sputum and hold off on
   antibiotics. Will f/u CTA read.

Passage 3 (ID: episode_436372_piece_14, Score: 3.28):
"Note Piece 14"
CTA (wet read)
   without clear central clot, subpulmonic loculated effusion on L,
   perihilar / dependent GG changes. Agree with plan to manage acute respiratory distress with HR/BP control
   with labetalol IV and lasix for likely volume overload and element of
   acute diastolic heart failure given preserved EF on recent echo. No
   clear signs of nosocomial pneumonia, will check sputum and hold off on
   antibiotics. Will f/u CTA read. Ativan for possible withdrawal per
   CIWA.

LLM REASONING:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reasoning block 1:
- Hypertension is defined as a persistent systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or higher, or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or higher.
- Without specific blood pressure measurements or medical records, it's impossible to diagnose hypertension.

Reasoning block 2:
- The notes do not mention blood pressure readings directly.
- There is no explicit mention of hypertension or its management.
- However, one note mentions "acute diastolic heart failure" which could be related to hypertension, but this is not definitive.

================================================================================
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
================================================================================
The patient has hypertension.

================================================================================
CLASSIFIED PHENOTYPES:
================================================================================
1. Essential hypertension
2. Hypertension with complications and secondary hypertension
