INITIAL SUMMARY (from last section of note):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Summary of Diagnoses and Conditions:**

- **Primary Diagnosis:** Colorectal cancer (colon cancer) post-laparoscopic sigmoidectomy and coloproctostomy
- **Secondary Conditions:**
  - Hypoxemia
  - Diabetes Mellitus, Type II
  - Hypertension, Benign
  - Alcohol Abuse
  - Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)
  - Volume Overload
  - Potential Pulmonary Edema
  - Hypercarbia
  - Hyperlipidemia

**Key Findings:**
- The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, alcohol abuse, and obesity.
- Post-operative hypoxia is suspected to be due to volume overload and potential pulmonary edema.
- Hypercarbia is attributed to OSA and obesity.
- The patient is hypertensive and tachycardic, likely due to not taking home medications, pain, and possible alcohol withdrawal.
- The patient is on a full liquid diet and requires glycemic control with regular insulin.
- He is on medications including metoprolol and captopril for blood pressure and heart rate management.
- The patient is in the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions.
